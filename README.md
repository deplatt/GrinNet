# GrinNet

## Product Description
GrinNet seeks to address the unique challenges of Grinnell’s community by offering an organized, accessible, and interest-focused platform. Unlike traditional social media platforms, GrinNet is tailored specifically for Grinnell students, leveraging the shared context of campus life. The existing systems such as email notifications and physical bulletin boards with event flyers often fall short of their goal due to information overload. GrinNet streamlines these processes by allowing students to sift through categorized posts, ensuring relevance and fostering meaningful interactions.
GrinNet will segment posts into broad categories such as gaming, sports, educational, and social, allowing users to easily find content relevant to their interests. Clubs and organizations will be able to create accounts as well, posting event details directly to the app and reducing reliance on overcrowded email inboxes or bulletin boards. In addition, GrinNet will have features like direct messaging to enable seamless collaboration and socialization among students (and/or organizations). Only Grinnell students can join, verified through their college email address.
