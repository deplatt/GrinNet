# Sprint 1 Planning Report

## Capacity
We will each aim to put in at least 6 hours of progress outside of class over the course of sprint 1. As it is the very first sprint, we do not yet have context for how far our time will go. This is a particularly busy week for many of us, with tests and atheltic competitions over the weeks.

## Goals
We will aim to complete the following tasks, as dictated by the Sprint 1 requirements.
- We will revise our living document based on the peer reviews we got on the project proposal.
- We will create a sprint journal to document our progress and answer questions about the sprint
- We will write at least five use cases for the software
- We will create a paper prototype for the UI of our software
- We will ask one peer for feedback on our prototype
- We will find three more stakeholders from outside the class to get more feedback
- We will complete a storyboard showing an example of a human using our product
- We will complete the CIDER Lab
- We will write our sprint review report to demonstrate to customers what progress we have made
- We will complete a sprint retrospective report to evaluate our progress in the sprint as a team
- We will individually complete a pulse check to gauge how well the sprint went
- We will update our living document as we go with the progress we have made.
