# Sprint 4 Journal

Internal Documentation Lab: Partners: Shibam (Teammate A), Anthony and Pranav (Teammates B)
Code Selected: Flutter_GrinNet/lib/pages/create_post.dart (Lines 1 - 157)

**Teammate B Review:**

Task description : 
we arrive at the create post page by clicking on the “+” button. It  allows users to create a post, with or without an image, for other users to view. Could include the task description at the top of the file.

Changes needed :
Comments on some methods but not others. Ones without comments are _submitPost (line 41).

No comments on classes. Class CreatePostScreen (line 8), _CreatePostScreenState (line 15) needs comments.  

Additionally, widget build (line 88) is a big block of code with no in-line comments. While there is an explanatory comment at the start of the widget, it is difficult to follow along with the specifics of the internal code without further comments.  

Lastly, it would be very helpful for the class and method comments to include preconditions and postconditions, and parameters and exceptions (if applicable). This would help follow the logic of the code with much more ease.
