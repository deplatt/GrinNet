# Sprint 2 Planning Report

## Capacity
We will each aim to put 8 hours of work in for this sprint. Since the sprint is only about one week, we cannot reasonably put in more than that and still stay on top of our other classes.

## Goals
- Practice writing good commit messages
- Develop good code review habits
- Fully implement and document all technical processes (version control, testing, CI, etc.)
- Complete an end-to-end implementation of the app
    - We are not planning on finishing an MVP this sprint
    - We will work on connecting our frontend and backend
    - We will continue developing the frontend, including login page
    - We will connect the login to Firebase authentication
        - We will send a user a working link through email that they can click to verify their account

## Task Breakdown
Everyone:
- Complete code reviews of all code being pushed to main
