# Sprint 3 Review Report 

## Description of what we completed this sprint

At the end of the third sprint, we were able to:
- Implement 4 different pages: Login, View Post, Create Post, and home page
- This means that for this 4 pages we have a complete User face that works as intended
- Login Page allows user to either login or register an account. We were able to implement firebase authentition wich will check that the email and password match with the information in our data base.
- We have also provided some test to see that the UI elements are rendering correctly and showing the text/images they are supposed to
- We have also tests for mocked logins using the Mocktail library in the flutter testing package to simulate a regular user login.
- In the home page we have successfully displayed the posts, including the posts that appeared after we creating using the new post feature.
- You can scroll through the posts which are presented in order of creation.
- You can also search based on tags and events 

## How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? 
The product has improved a lot from a costumer perspective since we finally have a visible product. Eventhough there is still a lot of work to put into the product, we have a UI and some basic functionality. The user will be able to register and login, search from posts, create posts and see posts. In other words, the costumer finally has a version of the app! It is no longer just resports and answers to questions, this is actually a product.
## What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?
A lot of time investigating, learning, and testing the dart language as well as Node.js. In addition, we have had several meetings discussing and working, there has been time dedicated to write reports like this and other miscellaneous requirements.
