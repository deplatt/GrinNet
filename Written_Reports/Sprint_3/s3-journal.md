# Sprint 3 Journal

<!-- As before, for any changes to the Requirements Document, add a link to a difference document in your Sprint Journal. The difference document is separate from the Requirements Document and there are a couple ways to create it:

1) Format added text with underline and deleted text with strikethrough.
2) Generate a URL comparing commits of your document before and after changes.
If your Requirements Document did not change this sprint, clearly say so in your Sprint Journal. -->

We did not make any changes to our Requirements Document during this sprint. 

### Summmary of Progress
In this sprint, we prepared for our upcoming demo by completing an end-to-end implementation of our project. 

Behind the scenes, we created tests for the frontend and backend and integrated these tests with Github Actions to automatically test the project whenever a commit is made. We exercised good coding and version control practices by creating branches with git and developing within those branches instead of main. We completed a code review every time we wanted to merge a branch into main to make sure that the main branch is clean and functional. We made many revisions to our code based on these code reviews, and we documented our code as we went to ensure readability and clarity.

We made a significant amount of technical progress as well. We developed a functional fronend for our app. This includes a sign-in page, register account page, homepage with a feed of posts, a create post page, and a profile page where the user can view their previous posts.
