# Sprint 1 Review Report 

## Description of what we completed this sprint

At the end of the first sprint, we were able to: 

- Complete an initial revision our living document based on the peer reviews we got on the project proposal.
- Create a sprint joutnal to document our progress and keep track of the specific questions and tasks we were require to complete during this sprint.
- Write 5 unique use cases for the software, incorporating our 2 personas, regular user and administrator user.
- Create a paper prototype that reflected the user cases.
- Receive and document feedback given from a classmate on our initial paper prototype.
- Find 3 stakeholders from outside class to test our prototype and provide feedback.
- Complete intervews with the stakeholders where we were able to ask for feedback and demosntrate the functionality of our paper prototype
- Implentt revisions based on the feedback given by all the people who tested our prototype (Classmate,Professor, 3 Stakeholders)
- Complete a storyboard showing an example of a human using our product
- We were able to receive feedback from another group using the CIDER technique.
- Document our revisions and provide photographic evidence about the changes implemented to our prototype after the feedback we received
- Update our requirments based on all the feedback gather during this sprint. 


## How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? 
From a costumer perspective the greatest advance from this sprint is the desing of the UI of the app. Before this sprint we as a team had discussed the general ideas of the app, but after this sprint we were able to consolidate the UI design as well as making some adjustments to our app idea. With the creation of the paper prototype the costumer can see in detail how the app is going to be designed as well as all the funcitonalities it includes in Minimun Viable Product face. Having the clarity on the order of screens, the amount of buttons, the number of clicks required to get from a place one place to another, will help a lot when coding the UI. 


## What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?
All the revisions that we made for our prototopy are not visible to a common user. In our opion the essenc of the sprint 1 was to recollect feedback and implement those changes from the feedback we recieved along the way. However, the common user wil only be able to see the latest version of our prototype, one that has been improved taking into account the commentary of naive user and non-naive users. As well as a feedback process given to use by the CIDER technique, were we focused on accesibility rather than just common functionality. All this changes, meetings with stakeholder, and discussions over our product will not be visible to the common user, as the common user will just use the best version of our app.
