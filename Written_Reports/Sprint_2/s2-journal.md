# Sprint 1 Journal

## Part 2: Software Architecture

<!-- For each of two decisions pertaining to your software architecture, identify and briefly describe an alternative. For each of the two alternatives, discuss its pros and cons compared to your choice. -->

## Part 5: Process Description

### 5.1: Risk Assessment

<!-- In your Sprint Journal, write an entry to identify the top three risks to successful completion of your project.

For each, give:

Likelihood of occurring (high, medium, low)
Impact if it occurs (high, medium, low)
Evidence upon which you base your estimates, such as what information you have already gathered or what experiments you have done
Steps you are taking to reduce the likelihood or impact, and steps to permit better estimates
Plan for detecting the problem (trivial example: running automated tests to determine that a file format has changed)
Mitigation plan should it occur
Be specific. If part of your risk analysis could be included in a different team's sprint journal, then you are probably not being specific enough. -->


### 5.2: Epics

<!-- An epic is a series of issues that come together to create an identifiable feature group. Completion of an epic may span multiple sprints.
Divide your planned work into about 3-6 epics. For each epic, write in your Sprint Journal:

- Description -- What will this epic achieve?
- Dependencies --  What (other epic) needs to be done before this epic can be started?
- Effort estimate -- How many person-week units do you expect it will take (If 3 team members will work on it for 2 weeks, that's 6 person-weeks.)
- Subtasks -- In the backlog of your Issue Manager, label tasks so they can easily be identified as part of the given epic. Create any relevant tasks that do not exist yet. Note that issues do not need to be well formed until they are added to the current sprint backlog. -->

### 5.3: Documentation Plan

<!-- In your Requirements Document, outline a plan for the documentation that you plan to deliver with the system, e.g., user guides, admin guides, developer guides, man pages, help menus, wikis, etc. Make sure to create corresponding issues in your Issue Manager. -->

## Part 6: Continuous Integration Plan

<!-- In your Sprint Journal, write a test plan, describing:

- Your test library (e.g., JUnit, Mocha, Pytest, etc).
- A brief justification for why you chose that test library.
- Your CI service and how your project repository is linked to it. (GitHub Actions is the recommended CI service.)
- A brief justification for why you chose that CI service. -->

## Part 7: Test Automation and Continuous Integration Setup

<!-- In your Sprint Journal, include a screenshot of your successful tests to demonstrate that they have run and passed. -->
