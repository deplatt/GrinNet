# Sprint 2 Review Report 

## Description of what we completed this sprint

At the end of the second sprint, we: 
- Found pre-existing style guides for each language that we agree upon for use
- Designed an overview of our software architecture
- Elaborated on a few design decisions, providing alternatives with pros and cons
- Completed a description of the database orginization for the app
- Gave a detailed description of the components in the architecture
- Identify risks for the completion of our project
- Wrote 3-6 epics planning out certain subsets of the project 
- Created a roadmap for the timeline of our project
- Planned out a framework of documention for the app
- Wrote a plan for how we will implement continuous integration into our project
- Tested our continuous integration with a few sample tests

We also worked on completing the following additional goals:
- Started working on database setup 
- Set up a functional UI based on the paper prototype
- Completed tutorials for relevant tools such as flutter.


## How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? 
From a customer perspective, our product has progressed in the form of the UI of the app. We were able to create the frontend of the app which involved many features that we had discussed in our paper prototype. Currently, the app has a login screen, create post screen, settings page, user profile page and most importantly a home page with a working search engine to search through posts using (tags, usernames, and event descriptions). Through the creation of this front-end the customer can now review what the app currently looks like and what they would like further. 


## What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?
The progress not visible to the common user would be our backend progress. Anthony and Pranav created the database along with node.js commands so that when the front-end is ready it can connect to this backend. Anthony also worked on trying to get the remote connection to the database to work. They also completed the architecture and design of the entire software which is helpful to understand the software itself for future development. Additionally all the learning that the team went through to complete certain parts of the project is also progress that is not visible to the common user. For example, for software architecture and design Anthony and Pranav went through various tutorials and online sources to understand how to work on node.js along with postgresql database structure. For the front-end, Shibam, Deven and Jeronimo spent time on learning the core components of Flutter through tutorials and used that to create the frontend that executable now.
