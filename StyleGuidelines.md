For this project, we will expect any Dart code to be formatted accoring to the following style guide: \
https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style

This guide was chosen because it is the style guide on the offical Dart reference pages, so it is likely to result in the most transferable and standardized code. Dart also provides a command
```dart format``` which will automatically format dart code. 

For SQL, we will use the following guide: \
https://www.sqlstyle.guide/

This guide was chosen because it is comprehensive and provides good rationale.

To enforce proper style, team members are expected to bring any issues to the team's attention and judicously use ```dart format``` (in the case of dart code).
